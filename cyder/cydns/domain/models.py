class Domain(models.Model, ObjectUrlMixin):
    """A Domain is used as a foreign key for most DNS records.

    A domain's SOA should be shared by only domains within it's zone.

    If two domains are part of different zones, they (and their
    subdomains) will need different SOA objects even if the data contained
    in the SOA is exactly the same. Use the description field to
    distinguish between similar SOAs. This model enforces these
    requirements and will raise a ``ValidationError`` during
    :func:`clean` if it is violated.

    For example: Say we are authoritative for the domains (and zones)
    ``foo.com`` and ``baz.com``.  These zones should have different
    SOA's because they are part of two separate zones. If you had the
    subdomain ``baz.foo.com``, it could have the same SOA as the
    ``foo.com`` domain because it is in the same zone.

    Both 'forward' domains under TLD's like 'com', 'edu', and 'org' and
    'reverse' domains under the TLD's 'in-addr.arpa' and 'ip6.arpa' are stored
    in this table. At first glance it would seem like the two types of domains
    have disjoint data set's; record types that have a Foreign Key back to a
    'reverse' domain would never need to have a Foreign Key back to a 'forward'
    domain. This is not the case. The two main examples are NS and CNAME
    records. If there were two different domain tables, NS/CNAME records would
    need to a) have two different Foriegn Keys, or b) have seperate tables.

    Constraints on both 'forward' and 'reverse' Domains:

        *   A ``ValidationError`` is raised when you try to delete a
            domain that has child domains. A domain should only be deleted when
            it has no child domains.

        *   All domains should have a master (or parent) domain.  A
            ``ValidationError`` will be raised if you try to create an orphan
            domain that should have a master domain.

        *   If you are not authoritative for a reverse domain, set the ``soa``
            field to ``None``.

        *   The ``name`` field must be unique. Failing to make it unique will
            raise a ``ValidationError``.

    Constraints on 'reverse' Domains:

        *   A 'reverse' domain should have ``is_reverse`` set to True.

        *   A 'reverse' domain's name should end in either 'in-addr.arpa' or
            'ip6.arpa'

        *   When a PTR is added it is pointed back to a 'reverse' domain. This
            is done by converting the IP address to the connonical DNS form and
            then doing a longest prefix match against all domains that have
            is_reverse set to True.

    This last point is worth looking at further. When adding a new reverse
    domain, all records in the PTR table should be checked for a more
    appropriate domain. Also, when a domain is deleted, all PTR objects should
    be passed down to the parent domain.


    .. warning::

        Deleting a domain will delete all records associated to that domain.
